  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

  Here’s how it works:
</p>

<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>

<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 7 Yes!</li>
  <li>4, 5, 7 Yes!</li>
  <li>4, 2, 1 No.</li>
  <li>1, 2, 3 Yes!</li>
  <li>3, 9, 27 Yes!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Enter a sequence:

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.

<form class="" action="index.html" method="post">

  <label for="answer">Your answer:</label>
