<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>
<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

<p>
  Here’s how it works:
</p>

<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>

<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<ul>
  <!--<li>2,4,7 Yes!</li>
  #<li>8,4,7 No. </li>
  <li><%=@first_num%>,<%=@second_num%>,<%=@third_num%> yes!</li>
-->
<% @list_of_guesses.each do |guess| %>
<li>
  <%=guess.first%>
  <%=guess.second%>
  <%=guess.third%>

  <%if guess.first<guess.second && guess.second<guess.third%>
    Yes!
    <%else%>
    No.
    <%end%>
  </li>
  <%end%>
</ul>

<p>
  Enter a sequence:
</p>

<form action="http://localhost:3000/create_guess" >
  <label for="first"> First number:</label>
  <input id="first" type="text" placeholder="the first number" name="first_number">

  <label for="second"> Second number:</label>
  <input id="second" type="text" placeholder="the second number"name="second_number">

  <label for="third"> Third number:</label>
  <input id="third" type="text" placeholder="the third number"name="third_number">

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <strong>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</strong>
