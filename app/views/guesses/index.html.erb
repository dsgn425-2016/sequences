<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

  Here's how it works:
</p>
<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>
<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><%= @user_first %>, <%= @user_second %>, <%= @user_third %> <%= @result %>  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Enter a sequence:

  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input id="first" name="first_number" type="text" placeholder="First number">

  <label for="second">Second number:</label>
  <input id="second" name="second_number" type="text" placeholder="Second number">

  <label for="third">Third number:</label>
  <input id="third" name="third_number" type="text" placeholder="Third number">
