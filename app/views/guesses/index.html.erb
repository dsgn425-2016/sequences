  <h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>
  <p>
    A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

    Here’s how it works:

    We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.

    We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:

    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </p>

  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.


  <!-- <ul>
  <li>2,4,7,Yes!</li>
  <li>4,8,7,No!</li>
  <li>
  <%= @first_num %>,
  <%= @second_num %>,
  <%= @third_num %>,
</li>
</ul> -->

<u>
  <% @list_of_guesses.each do |guess| %>
  <li>
    <%= guess.first%>
    <%= guess.second%>
    <%= guess.third%>

    <% if guess.first < guess.second && guess.second < guess.third %>
    Yes!
    <% else %>
    No.
    <% end %>
  </li>
  <% end %>
</u>
