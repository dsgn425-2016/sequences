<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s how it works:
</p>

<p>
  We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>

<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <%= @list_of_guesses.count %>,
    <%= @outcome %>
    Yes!
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Enter a sequence:

  <input name="third_number" id="third "type="text" placeholder="The third number">

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.
